# DMOJ-Solutions

This is a repository of my current [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/user/jy900) solutions, all of which were written in C++. Downloading these solutions was made possible through another project of mine called [CPS](https://github.com/JonathanYuan900/CPS), a python webscraper.

## Navigation

When looking for the solution to a specific problem, find the file in [Solutions](https://github.com/JonathanYuan900/DMOJ-Solutions/tree/main/Solutions) corresponding to its problem code (problem codes are found after the last '/' in the URL, e.g. https://dmoj.ca/problem/noi09p3 contains the problem code _noi09p3_).
